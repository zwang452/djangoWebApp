# djangoWebApp
Project djangoWebApp is a basic blogging web application that allows admins to update authors and posts into its database with simple HTML forms.
This project is created as part of the Co=op application to SmallCloud Technologies using Django and Tailwind CSS.

## Views/functionalities implemented

1. List view of posts using a template
2. Detail view of each post using a template
3. Posts, authors and categories information are stored using SQLite
3. An html form is provided for users to create a post that will be posted to the database

## Shortcomings/future works

1. Tailwind CSS could be incorporated into the build to allow for more styling options
2. Responsive web design should be added to browse on all devices
3. Looking of page has a lot of room for improvement
